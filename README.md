# Air Quality Model

## Overview

This project contains a Jupyter notebook for air quality forecasting and analysis. The notebook implements machine learning models to predict air quality metrics and provides data visualization and analysis tools.

## Dataset Information

The project uses two main datasets:

- `train.csv`: Contains the training data used for model development and training
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data used for model evaluation and predictions

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (install using pip):
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd Air-quality-model
   ```

2. Ensure the data files are in the correct location:

   - Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the `data/` directory

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook/air_quality_forecasting_Mugisha_Kenny_Kevin.ipynb
   ```

## Features

- Air quality data analysis and visualization
- Machine learning models for air quality forecasting
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data from the data/ directory
   - Perform exploratory data analysis
   - Train and evaluate models
   - Generate predictions and visualizations
